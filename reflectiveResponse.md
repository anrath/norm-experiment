> What unique challenges do you foresee in developing and integrating AI regulatory agents for legal compliance from a full-stack perspective? How would you address these challenges to make the system robust and user-friendly?

Developing and integrating AI regulatory agents for legal compliance faces (1) domain-specific, i.e. legal, challenges and (2) general engineering challenges. Here, I outline the most pressing challenges in each category and how we can address them through thoughtful, user-focused full-stack engineering and systems design.

# 1. Challenges working in the legal domain
Laws have a logic-based structure, which is not common to how most people think. For readers living in New York, likely your most common interaction with the law is your yearly lease. There are clauses that define names or terms that are used liberally throughout the rest of the document, or sentence structures that have specific legal force given how they are written. When we apply AI agents to the law, the semantics we use need to be hyper-specific. We can approach this through context engineering, but we first must elicit the ontology of the firm with the documents the agent is acting on. For example, firms define terms like "division," "operating group," and "business unit" differently. A firm may use specific non-GAAP financial metrics in its external reporting, which sound similar to standard metrics that require no compliance language. Context engineering is crucial to avoiding the pitfalls of ambiguous semantics.

Even if we correctly apply the semantic context of the client's business, we need to ensure we are applying the most up-to-date legal precedent. Laws are ever-evolving, so compliance confirmation needs to evolve with the law. To ensure we are always getting the latest legal inputs, we should query not just based on document semantics but on legal relationships as well. For instance, if we find that legal precedent A is most relevant to the document at hand, we should do a subsequent call to find all other legal precedents that cite precedent A to confirm we are drawing from the most updated legal standards, even when they are not the most semantically similar.

# 2. General engineering challenges with AI agents

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a key technique for addressing legal compliance with language models at scale. There are several common engineering challenges with RAG that are relevant to this application: OCR fidelity on input documents, chunking strategies for accurate matching while maintaining enough surrounding chunk context (e.g. overlapping chunks, variable chunk sizing, etc.), multi-modal compliance for image and video content, scaling large vector databases for retrieval, and applying re-ranking models to retrieved content when applicable. All of these design decisions need to be carefully evaluated and A/B tested to find the optimal strategy given the legal compliance domain.

Humans also play an important role in the AI compliance process. The system should carefully protect against over-reliance on AI for critical compliance situations (which is more critical as models approach 100% accuracy) and user fatigue, which can diminish product satisfaction and impact the ability to improve the AI through post-training. Specifically, the system should avoid context shifts for the user. The front-end should place documents under review side by side with the relevant legal context, clearly highlighting the important sections. The user should be encouraged to identify when the AI is correct and when/where it is wrong in order to feed the data back into a post-training loop. From personal experience, I can say that it is greatly satisfying to see an LLM successfully complete a task it previously could not get right through your steering.

Both domain-specific challenges and general challenges have implications for the full-stack design of a probabilistic/agentic compliance AI system. I believe that we, as a software development and machine learning community, are tackling many of the same problems. Many of the advances in industry and academia over recent years can be tested and applied to tackle these core challenges for compliance AI regulatory agents.
